.h1 jQuery Custom Scrollbar

jQuery Custom Scrollbar is a jQuery plugin that lets you add fully customizable scrollbars to your sites. With the plugin
you can apply any css styles you want to your scrollbars.

.h2 Features

* vertical and horizontal scrollbars you can style your own way
* a couple predefined skins showing you how to style scrollbars
* scrolling by mouse dragging, mouse wheel, keyboard - just as you would with native browser scrollbar
* simple api that lets you scroll programmatically

.h2 Requirements

The plugin supports all major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE 7+.

To use the plugin you obviously need jQuery (it should work in jQuery 1.4 and later versions).

.h2 Basic Usage

First download and add jquery.custom-scrollbar.min.js and jquery.custom-scrollbar.css to your site.

Suppose you have a container on your site with some lengthy content and you want to make it scrollable:

<pre><code>

<div class="container">
  <!-- Some lengthy content -->
</div>

</code></pre>

Define it's width and height (below some example size is used):

<pre><code>

.container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 400px;
}

</pre></code>

Add a skin class you want to use to your container:

<pre><code>
<div class="container default-skin">
  <!-- Some lengthy content -->
</div>
</pre></code>

Finally call this js code:

<pre><code>

$(document).ready(function() {
  $(".container").customScrollbar();
});

</pre></code>

If container content does not fit in those sizes scrollbar will appear.

The above method will add vertical scrollbar. If you also want to add horizontal scrollbar, there is one more css step required:

<pre><code>

.container .overview {
  width: 1000px;
}

</pre></code>

This defines total width of the scrolled content (not just the width of the visible part as in previous step).
